Sometimes things suck. Sometimes you need a little jolt of positivity to keep you motivated, sometimes you need it in your terminal.

## Install & Use

```sh
npm install -g inspire-cli

inspire

inspire --direction left # left aligns the quote box
```
and it outputs

```

## Quotes

I'm a little short on quotes, so if you want to see more, submit an issue with the text and the origin of the quote you want and if it's positive and awesome, I'll add it into the project.
